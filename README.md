# CartogWEPer
An Android application that passively records information about nearby wireless networks.

The application allows users to:
* record the results of access point scans
* view statistics about a particular scan
* export the results to a KML file
* configure scan settings.

Please note that this is an unfinished project.

## Prerequisites
Import the project into Android Studio to build it. A Google Maps API key is required. See the [Google Maps Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start) for instructions. Tested on Android 8.0 (Oreo).
