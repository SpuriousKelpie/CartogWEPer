# CartogWEPer
An Android application for passively scanning open access points and recording their broadcasted attributes.

CartogWEPer has the following functionality:
- Record the SSID, MAC address, security protocol, and GPS coordinates of nearby access points.
- View statistics from a wardriving session (e.g. number of WEP networks scanned).
- Export a wardriving session to a KML (Google Maps) or CSV file.

This is a work-in-progress originally written for a university module. Use [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/tools) instead.
